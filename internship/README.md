# internship_matching
The proposed system is used by two types of users namely; 
the Human resource  department of the company and the student of the MUBAS in the faculty of applied sciences. 
The Human resource personnel responsible for adding vacancies will post the vacancies with as  much detail as possible to help the algorithm 
narrow down the most fit candidates. Once the  system identifies the students that are fit for the position posted, the system will send a  notification 
to the matched student prompting them to accept or deny the request for an interview  with the company based on what the students wants.
The company then send an interview  schedule to the student. Once the interviews are done on a platform outside the system,
the  company then through the system will send a notification to the student letting them know  whether they have been offered the internship position or not.
